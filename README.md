# 256-bit-AES-Encryption-and-Decryption
Implemented 256-bit AES encryption algorithm in Verilog to encrypt the transmitted data into Cipher Text. Deployed algorithms like Substitute Bytes, Shift Rows, Mix Columns and Add Round Key in the design. Performed STA in OpenSTA, ASIC flow in Openlane using skywater 130nm pdk &amp; viewed layout in Klayout
